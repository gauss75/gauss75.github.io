# Jekyll will not replace liquid tags inside YML files, so if you want to put in a link within the caption, you have to put in the
# entire thing, e.g. href="http://brown.edu/Research/Ramachandran_Lab/files/...", and not just a relative link.
# I also included support for an optional 'title' attribute for a while but eventually removed it. We could add this back in if we want.

  caption: "Locations of HGDP Eurasian populations and Native American populations from Wang et al. (2007, PLoS Genetics) that were analyzed by Ramachandran and Rosenberg (2011, AJPA). This comparative study of genetic differentiation on two continents showed that populations are more differentiated along the major axis of the Americas than along the major axis of Eurasia, perhaps due to the relative ease of migration east-west compared to migration north-south."
